## What is Agents?

<!--BEGIN_DESCRIPTION-->

The Agent Framework is designed for building realtime, programmable participants
that run on servers. Use it to create conversational, multi-modal voice
agents that can see, hear, and understand.

## Features

- **Flexible integrations**: A comprehensive ecosystem to mix and match the right STT, LLM, TTS, and Realtime API to suit your use case.
- **Integrated job scheduling**: Built-in task scheduling and distribution with [dispatch APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/dispatch/) to connect end users to agents.
- **Extensive WebRTC clients**: Build client applications using LiveKit's open-source SDK ecosystem, supporting all major platforms.
- **Telephony integration**: Works seamlessly with LiveKit's [telephony stack](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/), allowing your agent to make calls to or receive calls from phones.
- **Exchange data with clients**: Use [RPCs](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/rpc/) and other [Data APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/) to seamlessly exchange data with client applications.
- **Semantic turn detection**: Uses a transformer model to detect when a user is done with their turn, helps to reduce interruptions.
- **MCP support**: Native support for MCP. Integrate tools provided by MCP servers with one loc.
- **Builtin test framework**: Write tests and use judges to ensure your agent is performing as expected.
- **Open-source**: Fully open-source, allowing you to run the entire stack on your own servers, including [LiveKit server](https://github.com/livekit/livekit), one of the most widely used WebRTC media servers.

## Installation

To install the core Agents library, along with plugins for popular model providers:

```bash
pip install "livekit-agents[openai,silero,deepgram,cartesia,turn-detector]~=1.0"
```

## Docs and guides

Documentation on the framework and how to use it can be found [here](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/)

## Core concepts

- Agent: An LLM-based application with defined instructions.
- AgentSession: A container for agents that manages interactions with end users.
- entrypoint: The starting point for an interactive session, similar to a request handler in a web server.
- Worker: The main process that coordinates job scheduling and launches agents for user sessions.

## Usage

### Simple voice agent

---

```python
from livekit.agents import (
    Agent,
    AgentSession,
    JobContext,
    RunContext,
    WorkerOptions,
    cli,
    function_tool,
)
from livekit.plugins import deepgram, elevenlabs, openai, silero

@function_tool
async def lookup_weather(
    context: RunContext,
    location: str,
):
    """Used to look up weather information."""

    return {"weather": "sunny", "temperature": 70}


async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    await ctx.connect()

    agent = Agent(
        instructions="You are a friendly voice assistant built by LiveKit.",
        tools=[lookup_weather],
    )
    session = AgentSession(
        vad=silero.VAD.load(),
        # any combination of STT, LLM, TTS, or realtime API can be used
        stt=deepgram.STT(model="nova-3"),
        llm=openai.LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
        tts=elevenlabs.TTS(),
    )

    await session.start(agent=agent, room=ctx.room)
    await session.generate_reply(instructions="greet the user and ask about their day")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    cli.run_app(WorkerOptions(entrypoint_fnc=entrypoint))
```

You'll need the following environment variables for this example:

- DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ELEVEN_API_KEY

### Multi-agent handoff

---

This code snippet is abbreviated. For the full example, see [multi_agent.py](examples/voice_agents/multi_agent.py)

```python
...
class IntroAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__(
            instructions=f"You are a story teller. Your goal is to gather a few pieces of information from the user to make the story personalized and engaging."
            "Ask the user for their name and where they are from"
        )

    async def on_enter(self):
        self.session.generate_reply(instructions="greet the user and gather information")

    @function_tool
    async def information_gathered(
        self,
        context: RunContext,
        name: str,
        location: str,
    ): 
        """Called when the user has provided the information needed to make the story personalized and engaging.

        Args:
            name: The name of the user
            location: The location of the user
        """

        context.userdata.name = name
        context.userdata.location = location

        story_agent = StoryAgent(name, location)
        return story_agent, "Let's start the story!"


class StoryAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name: str, location: str) -> None:
        super().__init__(
            instructions=f"You are a storyteller. Use the user's information in order to make the story personalized."
            f"The user's name is {name}, from {location}"
            # override the default model, switching to Realtime API from standard LLMs
            llm=openai.realtime.RealtimeModel(voice="echo"),
            chat_ctx=chat_ctx,
        )

    async def on_enter(self):
        self.session.generate_reply()


async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    await ctx.connect()

    userdata = StoryData()
    session = AgentSession[StoryData](
        vad=silero.VAD.load(),
        stt=deepgram.STT(model="nova-3"),
        llm=openai.LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
        tts=openai.TTS(voice="echo"),
        userdata=userdata,
    )

    await session.start(
        agent=IntroAgent(),
        room=ctx.room,
    )
...
```

### Testing

Automated tests are essential for building reliable agents, especially with the non-deterministic behavior of LLMs. LiveKit Agents include native test integration to help you create dependable agents and ensure your application runs smoothly.

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_no_availability() -> None:
    llm = google.LLM()
    ...
```
